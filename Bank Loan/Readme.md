## 🔍 Power BI Concepts:

Power BI is a powerful data visualization tool that allows you to connect to various data sources, transform the data, and create interactive reports and dashboards.

###  Some of the key concepts in Power BI are:

📚 Data modeling: organizing the data into tables, creating relationships between tables, and defining calculated columns and measures.

🔢 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): a formula language used in Power BI for creating custom calculations and aggregations.

🔎 Power Query: a data transformation and cleaning tool that allows you to import data from various sources, filter, sort, and reshape the data.

📈 Charts: different types of visualizations that allow you to present the data in a meaningful way, such as bar charts, line charts, pie charts, and maps.
